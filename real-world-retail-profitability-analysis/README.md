# Real World Retail Profitability Analysis

# Overview
This project analyzes six months of sales data from a small retail store. 
The objective is to understand sales performance, profitability and category contribution using real world, manually recorded data.
The analysis aim to support practical decisions related to pricing, inventory focus and business stability.

# Business Question
1. Which categories generates the most revenue and profit?
2. How does daily and monthly performance vary over time?
3. Which categories shows high sales volume but low margins?
4. How stable is the business across observed period?

# Data Reality
- Sales data was manually recorded in notebooks and later digitized into a structured format
- Records vary in consistency and level of detail reflecting real operational constraints of a small retail business
- To ensure analytical reliability, data was standardized at category level and limited to a six month period

# Dataset
- transactions.csv: Transaction-level sales data
- product_master.csv: Standardized cost reference by category

# Tools Used
- Excel: Data digitization and profit calculations
- SQL: Profitability and trend analysis
- Power BI: Executive-level profitability dashboard

# Key Analysis
- Calculated revenue, profit and profit margin at transaction level
- Aggregated performance by category to compare revenue vs profitability
- Analyzed monthly revenue and profit trends to asses business stability
- Identified categories with high sales volume but relatively lower profit contribution

# Key Insights
- Revenue is concentrated in a small number of categories, with Protective Accessories contributing the largest share of both revenue and profit
- Some categories with strong sales volume generate significantly lower profit margins, indicating efficiency gaps
- Profitability varies more across categories then revenue, highlighting the impact of cost structure and pricing
- Monthly profit shows higher volatility than revenue, suggesting sensitivity to cost fluctuations rather then demand alone

# Recomendations
- Prioritize inventory, shelf space and promotions for consistently high margin categories
- Review pricing and sourcing strategies for high volume but lower margin categories to improve profitability
- Monitor trends alongside revenue to avoid revenue led but profit negative decisions

# Outcome
This project demonstrates the ability to work with messy real world data, apply defensible assumptions and deliever business focused insights.
